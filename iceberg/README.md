# RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark Iceberg Support

The Iceberg support is organized into multiple Maven projects, one per Iceberg minor
version that is supported. This allows each submodule to build against the Iceberg minor
version it supports.

# Iceberg Submodules

The following table shows the mapping of Iceberg versions to their supported Spark version
and the directory that contains the corresponding support code.

| Iceberg Version | Spark Version              | Directory         |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| 1.6.x           | Spark 3.5.1-3.5.3          | `iceberg-1-6-x`  |
| 1.9.x           | Spark 3.5.5-3.5.9          | `iceberg-1-9-x`  |
| 1.10.x          | Spark 3.5.6-3.5.9, 4.0.x  | `iceberg-1-10-x` |
| 1.11.x          | Spark 4.0.2+, 4.1.x        | `iceberg-1-11-x` |

Iceberg GPU acceleration is currently supported on Spark 3.5.x, 4.0.x, and 4.1.x.
The authoritative integration-test compatibility list, including upstream-compatible
combinations that are not currently packaged, is maintained in
[`iceberg-versions.json`](iceberg-versions.json).

Each matrix entry describes one Apache Iceberg runtime version tested by cudf-spark. For that
Iceberg release, `upstream_minimums` is copied from the Spark versions in Apache Iceberg's
`gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Each key is a Spark major/minor family, and its value is the patch
release that Iceberg builds and tests against; cudf-spark treats that patch as the minimum
upstream-compatible version.

The `spark_versions` list is computed from the `spark*.version` properties in the root `pom.xml`.
For each family in `upstream_minimums`, it contains every cudf-spark shim whose patch version is
greater than or equal to the upstream minimum. A shim is marked as supported when cudf-spark
packages the corresponding Iceberg integration module. Upstream-compatible shims that are not
packaged remain in the list with `supported` set to `false` and an explanation in `reason`.

For Spark 3.5.4+, both `iceberg-1-9-x` and `iceberg-1-10-x` modules are compiled into the
build. The integration-test support baseline follows the Spark patch versions used to build
the corresponding Apache Iceberg release. The correct version-specific implementation is
selected at runtime by probing the `iceberg-spark-runtime` jar on the classpath.
Version-specific code lives in distinct sub-packages (`iceberg19x`, `iceberg110x`,
`iceberg111x`) to avoid class conflicts, and the common `ShimUtils` dispatcher delegates to
the appropriate implementation.

For Spark 4.0.0-4.0.1, only `iceberg-1-10-x` is compiled during the build. For Spark
4.0.2+, both `iceberg-1-10-x` and `iceberg-1-11-x` are compiled, and the correct
implementation is selected at runtime.

For Spark 4.1.x, only `iceberg-1-11-x` is compiled during the build. Apache Iceberg
publishes the `iceberg-spark-runtime-4.1` artifact starting at version 1.11.0, so earlier
Iceberg releases cannot be used with Spark 4.1.

## Code Shared Between Modules

The `common` directory contains code that is shared across some or all of the Iceberg
submodules. It is not built directly as a Maven submodule but simply houses common code
that is picked up by the Iceberg submodules via the Maven build helper plugin.

| Directory                         | Description                              |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `common/src/main/scala`           | Scala code shared across all versions    |
| `common/src/main/java`            | Java code shared across all versions     |
| `common/src/main/spark35x/java`   | Java code for Spark 3.5.x only           |
